Document Objectives:
To compile a comprehensive list of GF alcoholic beverage options.

Application Objectives:
GFAR is a full-stack web application that enables users to find out the origins of an alcohol and what it’s base ingredients are. The main use of GFAR will be for celiacs to look up alcohol types to quickly  determine if a certain alcohol is gluten free or not. The homepage of the app will give a description of celiac disease, why this app was created and a disclaimer that while everything is up to date, that manufactures can change their recipes anytime and if they’re not sure about an alcohol to contact the manufacturer. Alcohols listed on the app will have a description, where it’s made(origin), ingredients listed, ABV(alcohol by volume), and whether or not it’s safe for celiacs. While the app can be accessed by anyone, if users want to leave a comment on certain alcohols or save what their favorites are, they’ll have to log in.  A contact page will also be included for people to suggest alcohols to add as well send questions.
